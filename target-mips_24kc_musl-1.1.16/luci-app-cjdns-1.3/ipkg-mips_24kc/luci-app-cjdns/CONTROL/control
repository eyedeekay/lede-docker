Description:  This package allows you to configure and inspect cjdns networking using LuCI.
 
 Cjdns implements an encrypted IPv6 network using public-key cryptography
 for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing.
 This provides near-zero-configuration networking, and prevents many
 of the security and scalability issues that plague existing networks.
